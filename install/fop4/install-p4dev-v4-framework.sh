# system that does not have Python2 installed on it when it starts,
# and tries never to install Python2, pip2, nor any Python2 packages
# or libraries.

# As of 2020-Dec, the open source P4 tools seem to be ready for this.

# In fact, this script does end up installing Python2, but only
# because installing Mininet as this script currently does, causes
# Python2 to be installed.  Before that point (near the end), Python2
# is never installed.

# The install steps for p4lang/PI and p4lang/behavioral-model end
# up installing Python module code in the site-packages directory
# mentioned below in this function.  That is were GNU autoconf's
# 'configure' script seems to find as the place to put them.

# On Ubuntu systems when you run the versions of Python that are
# installed via Debian/Ubuntu packages, they only look in a
# sibling dist-packages directory, never the site-packages one.

# If I could find a way to change the part of the install script
# so that p4lang/PI and p4lang/behavioral-model install their
# Python modules in the dist-packages directory, that sounds
# useful, but I have not found a way.

# As a workaround, after finishing the part of the install script
# for those packages, I will invoke this function to move them all

# On a freshly installed Ubuntu 20.04.1 or 18.04.5 system, desktop

# something to do with Ubuntu's desire to make it easy to connect with
# on-line accounts like Google accounts.

# This python3-protobuf package enables one to have a session like
# this with no error, on a freshly installed system:

# $ python3
# >>> import google.protobuf

# However, something about this script doing its work causes a
# conflict between the Python3 protobuf module installed by this
# script, and the one installed by the package python3-protobuf, such
# that the import statement above gives an error.  The package
# google.protobuf.internal is used by the p4lang/tutorials Python
# code, and the only way I know to make this work right now is to
# remove the Debian python3-protobuf package, and then install Python3
# protobuf support using pip3 as done below.

# Experiment starting from a freshly installed Ubuntu 20.04.1 Linux
